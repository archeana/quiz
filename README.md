## Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz
Welcome to the Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz project! This README file will provide you with an overview of the project, its structure, and how to use it.

## Project Overview
The Budget Bliss Financial Habits Quiz is a web-based interactive quiz that aims to help users understand their financial habits and identify areas where they can improve their expenses and save money. 
The quiz consists of 17 questions, each with multiple-choice answers. After answering each question, users will receive specific tips and, in some cases, links to additional resources. 
This was a project for a Challenge from CFG where each team had to build a product, app, or website that will empower everyday citizens to manage their budgets and help alleviate the challenges of the current cost of living crisis.
